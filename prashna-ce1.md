Test your skills on Azure fundamentals, IaC tools, and automation scripting during interviews. Focus on practical scenarios for Azure, Terraform, Ansible, Bash, Python, and PowerShell to demonstrate hands-on skills. These questions draw from common patterns in tech giant.[^1_1][^1_2]

## Azure Cloud Basics

Explain key Azure components like Virtual Machines, App Services, and Resource Manager, including how they interact in a multi-region setup. Describe cost optimization strategies, such as using Azure Advisor and reserved instances. How do you implement security with Azure Policy and ensure compliance in deployments?[^1_3][^1_2]

## Terraform IaC

What is Terraform's execution plan, and how does `terraform apply` use the state file to provision resources? Compare Terraform backends for state management, like local vs. Azure Blob Storage. How do you handle secrets and modules in Terraform for Azure infrastructure?[^1_4][^1_5][^1_6]

## Ansible Configuration

Explain Ansible's host inventory and how it groups servers for cloud provisioning playbooks. Describe using Ansible cloud modules to automate VM deployment and scaling in Azure. What ad-hoc commands would you run for quick config checks on remote Azure instances?[^1_7][^1_4]

## Bash \& Python Automations

Provide an example Bash script to automate Azure VM backups using az CLI. How would Python with Boto3 or Azure SDK script resource tagging for cost tracking? Discuss dependency management in Python scripts for cloud deployments, like using requirements.txt.[^1_8][^1_9]

## PowerShell in Azure

Write a PowerShell script to connect to Azure and scale an AKS cluster. Explain Azure PowerShell cmdlets for monitoring, like Get-AzMetric. How do you handle error handling and logging in PowerShell for IaC automation?[^1_2][^1_8]
